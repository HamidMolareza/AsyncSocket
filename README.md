# Asynchronous Client Socket Example

The following example program creates a **client** that connects to a server.
The client is built with an **asynchronous** socket,
so execution of the client application is not suspended while the server returns a response.
The application sends a string to the server and then displays the string returned by the server on the console.

# Reference
This source is based on the Microsoft site example. Microsoft example is written based on the old IAsyncResult pattern.
But this source is rewritten according to the **Task-based Asynchronous Pattern**. (TAP)

# Two Template
I use two template source for rewrite old pattern to Task-based Asynchronous Pattern.

**Template1:** use Begin* and End* methods to change Pattern.

**Template2:** use **base socket methods** to change Pattern. (like Send, Receive, and so on)
